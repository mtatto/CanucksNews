  <!-- The App element allows you to override the values that are extracted from the WMAppManifest.xml file automatically -->
  <!-- Important: if you use app title localization as described in: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff967550(v=VS.92).aspx
       ...then you need to override the 'Title' attribute of the 'App' node to provide the correct title explicitly here! -->
  <!-- The AdditionalNotes attribute has no equivalent in the WMAppManifest.xml; you can only define its content here -->
  <!-- Explicitly set any of the attributes to an empty string to remove it (including its label) from the dialog -->
